This project features a Pygame UI for playing wordle, and a solver to provide the best word.

To run the Wordle game, run `python wordle.py`. Type your guess and press enter to submit, the rules are the same as standard Wordle. Pressing `1` will reset the game.

This project also features a Wordle solver, which can be run using `python wordleSolver.py`. The solver will provide a word, and each letter should be clicked until it has the right colour. Then, pressing space will get the solver to provide its next clue.
